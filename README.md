# ✨ Your Bizarre Automation ✨

**Tired of that YBA grind? Tired of the economy being horrible? Are you sick of the awful admins in the game banning your accounts every time you get cool skins? This macro solves all these problems.**

*Automatically uses arrows/ribs to get shiny stands in [YBA](https://www.roblox.com/games/2809202155)* 🏹

## 🛠 Setup 🛠
1. Downlad AHK (Auto HotKey) from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Download the macro folder, or the entire repository if you'd like.
3. Make sure your screen resolution is 1920x1080.
4. Read IMPORTANT.txt.
5. Launch Main.ahk.
6. Update your ping delay depending on your ping in the game, if it is unstable then a private server is recommended.
7. Enjoy your shiny stands!

> Fun fact, I'm pretty sure this just got me banned from the game as of 11/14/2023 because they consider it an exploit, BUT it has absolutely 0 code injection into the Roblox client and is not :D
