      1. Equip a shiny stand.
      2. Open stand inventory (make sure equipped is at the top of the stand list).
      3. Press the = key.
      4. Prompt should pop up saying "Shiny detected."
⚠ IF A PROMPT DOES NOT POP UP, IT IS NOT DETECTING SHINIES, DO NOT USE THE LOOP KEYBIND IT WILL ROKA SHINY STANDS!!! (look at issues section)

Oh also, I am not responsible for losses/damages, I am not sorry :3

HEADS UP:
   •   If a prompt appears, or if the script/hotkeys stop working, press the . key, this unpauses the script.
   •   TAB is your panic button, do not hesitate to smack it.

Hotkeys:
      [-] ➔ Get max worthy.
      [=] ➔ Check for equipped shiny.
      [.] ➔ Unpause.
      [Insert] ➔ Stand cycle.
      [Home] ➔ Rib cycle.
      [Delete] ➔ Roka cycle.
      [Page Up] ➔ Arrow loop.
      [Page Down] ➔ Rib loop.
      [Tab] ➔ Reload (the panic button), also used to stop loops

Issues:
   •   Image detection not working (shinies and stuff), look at the image folder and do your best to recreat them, IMAGE NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE.
   •   Item/Image detection not working but item in hotbar, make sure your images have the top of them cut off (where the slot number would be)
